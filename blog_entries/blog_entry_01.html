        <p>I guess I am not very sure when was the moment I took on the decision of start to study coding for the first time, but I do remember the day I came home, I sat on the couch and I said to myself: “I need to change of job”. I mean, I have been involved with Game Jams, developing tiny games with my flatmate and reading frameworks manuals (like GameMaker or Unity 3D), but It was on September 2017 when I could not stand any further and decide to make a real change.</p>
        <p><br>In the past, I did not know how to start in the coding world. I started Android development, some java, C#… I drop it for a couple of years, take it back again with help of a friend and, after some years thinking I did not like it at all, I fell in love, fully, without doubts. I tried back C# and things that were difficult for me… they were easy now! I went from one book to another, pushing me every step outside of the comfort zone to properly learn further and, after some months, I knew I would not come back to a world were Coding was not part of my daily life. </p>

        <p>Then I met R. on my last job. He sat besides me and after discovering one day he was studying Java, he showed me <a href=“https://www.codewars.com/“ target=“_blank”>CodeWars</a> and along with a third colleague, we spoke about Coding and work along on some short coding challenges. I loved that. And on my last GameJam, I feel excited on the way we, D. <em>(a guy I met in a pub)</em> and I, were coding at the same time on the same project and, in three days, we finished it. <br><br>That was the <strong>very first step</strong> I took on moving to <a href=“www.codeclan.com” target=“_blank”>CodeClan</a> to make an attempt on change my career, after three years moving back and forth between Spain and Scotland. </p>
        <p>Then September happened. I was having a rough moment at my job, which I did not like it much but was comfortable. That day, during a short anxiety attack, the only way I could relax was working on the code of a personal project. It was very weird, but then I knew I could not go back, I needed a change. Remembering that R. applied to CodeClan and loved it, I tried too. I took the final step. Now I am just waiting to 5th March, when I will start a new adventure!</p>
